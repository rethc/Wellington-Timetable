A simple Metlink bus and train tracking application to get real time information and updates

***Application is  unpublished on the Play Store due to the fee changes to Google Map API services. There is now an Official Metlink Commuter App***


**Instructions:**

 1. Click on "Find my Stop" button to get map view of bus stops in
    Wellington. If you have GPS enabled you can click the compass icon
    to pan to your current location 
 2. Click on the marker and text window to get the list of real time buses at your stop.

If you already know your bus or station code you can enter it from the main menu. Click add to save this to your favourites list.

**To do:**
 - Add auto refresh on the timetable view 
 - Address search in map view

**Known Bugs:**
 - Clicking on an inactive bus stop or train station marker in map view. Markers are prepopulated on Metlink's API.
 - Some performance issues

v2.2 fixes:
 - set max zoom to stop overloading app with markers
